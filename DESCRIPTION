Description: 
    Bipartite graph-based hierarchical clustering performs hierarchical 
    clustering of groups of samples based on association patterns between two 
    sets of variables. It is developed for pharmacogenomic datasets and datasets 
    sharing the same data structure. In the context of pharmacogenomic datasets, 
    the samples are cell lines, and the two sets of variables are typically 
    expression levels and drug sensitivity values. For this method, sparse 
    canonical correlation analysis from Lee, W., Lee, D., Lee, Y. and 
    Pawitan, Y. (2011) <doi:10.2202/1544-6115.1638> is first applied to extract 
    association patterns for each group of samples. Then, a nuclear norm-based 
    dissimilarity measure is used to construct a dissimilarity matrix between 
    groups based on the extracted associations. Finally, hierarchical 
    clustering is applied.
