Description: 
    R package for performing bipartite graph-based hierarchical clustering on 
    pharmacogenomic data. To start, sparse canonical correlation 
    analysis is first applied to extract gene-drug associations for each group
    of cell lines. Then, a nuclear norm-based dissimilarity measure is used to
    construct a dissimilarity matrix between groups based on the extracted
    associations. Finally, hierarchical clustering is applied to the cell line 
    groups.
