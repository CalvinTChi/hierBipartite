\title{Processed Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal (CTRP2) Dataset}
\format{
A list with elements of gene expression, drug sensitivities, and group membership.
\describe{
  \item{X}{n x p gene expression matrix}
  \item{Y}{n x q drug sensitivities matrix}
  \item{groups}{List of starting groups. Each group is represented by a vector of row indices for X, Y.}
}

\usage{
data(ctrp2)
}
\description{
Smaller test dataset version of the "CTRP2" carcinoma dataset in the paper. Specifically,
only the top 1,000 transcripts by correlation with drug sensitivity are included instead of 5,000.
Otherwise the dataset has been processed exactly as described in the paper. Note the expression dataset is
provided by CCLE and the drug sensitivity dataset is provided by CTRP2, and the pharmacogenomic datasets in the paper are
are referred to by the resource providing the sensitivity data. The cell lines are grouped by carcinoma subtype and primary site (e.g. lung NSC).
