\title{Preprocessed Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) Dataset}
\format{A list with elements of gene expression, drug sensitivities, and group membership.
\describe{
  \item{X}{n x p gene expression matrix}
  \item{Y}{n x q drug sensitivities matrix}
  \item{groups}{List of starting groups. Each group is represented by a vector of row indices for X, Y.}
}}
\usage{
CCLE
}
\description{
The dataset from CCLE (2012) that has been preprocessed for bipartite hierarhical clustering. 
The preprocessing steps removed samples and features based on missingness, filtered out
genes with expression variance less than 3, and removed cell lines from tissues with less than
15 cell lines.
