#' Preprocessed Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) Dataset
#'
#' The dataset from CCLE (2012) that has been preprocessed for bipartite hierarhical clustering. 
#' The preprocessing steps removed samples and features based on missingness, filtered out
#' genes with expression variance less than 3, and removed cell lines from tissues with less than
#' 15 cell lines.
